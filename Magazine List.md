# Magazines / Fanzines
Magazines, fanzines, and zines are an important way for people to document music and the music scene in underground scenes. Because of Japan's insular nature, there were a few full-color, nationally-distributed magazines that covered the underground scene well. Rounding that out were zines and fanzines made by bands or members of the underground that were photocopied and distributed at shows, record stores, or through distros.
