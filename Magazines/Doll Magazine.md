# Doll Magazine
## Overview
Doll was one of the largest magazines in Japan that covered punk, hardcore, and other underground music. It mostly focused on larger acts, but often included underground Japanese acts as well. It had worldwide distribution, and I was even able to buy copies from Tower Records in Nashville, TN in the early 2000's. It ran from 1980 to 2009.
